        <img style="width:100%;height:auto;" src="organisation/orga-spiral.jpg" alt="IPP approach">
        <p>The team project aims to freely design and prototype an <b>interactive mobile application</b> in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You will work in five iterations (with corresponding milestones). Throughout each iteration, you will follow the user-centered design process. This design process includes analysis, design, implementation and evaluation.</p>
        <p>Prototype functionalities will be freely and independently designed by your team, depending on your creativity in brainstorming, the gathered user and usability requirements, as well as your use cases and scenarios. The user will be able to perform interactions, for example: buying, listing, viewing, informing, playing, searching.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> The course focuses on interaction <b>prototyping</b>. Even if your required/specified <em>feature</em> is not fully functional, you can simulate it and work on evaluating the corresponding <em>user interface.</em></p>
        <h4>General information on the practical course:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All the tasks during this project phase will be <b>group exercises</b> (groups of  persons). We recommend that every team member practices and contributes to the implementation part of the exercises. Establish interdisciplinary teams for working on your prototype. Find a name four your group.</li>
            <li>Each of the five iterations is planned for a <b>duration of two weeks.</b> Please ensure that you have pushed solutions for all exercises to GitHub at the end of the iteration. Your repository will be <a href="https://github.com/interactionprototyping">https://github.com/interactionprototyping/GROUP</a>, where GROUP is your group's chosen name. Set up a suitable file and folder structure; please indicate in the README.md, where your current version of your prototype can be found.</li>
            <li><b>Document your implementational and methodological progress/process</b> throughout the whole project in a brief, but suitable manner (beginning at the first iteration) on GitHub. This documentation will be <strong>taken into account</strong> for your final grade and will simplify the final project presentation, as you have already structured your results. By using the history functionality of GitHub, you may furthermore return to earlier versions of your prototype.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="grading">Expectations, requirements, and grading:</h4>
        <p class="alert alert-danger"><i class="fa fa-info"></i> Your final grade will consist of a <b>methodology (50%, documentation and final presentation)</b> and an <b>audit of your prototype (50%, ergonomics and HTML) </b> </p>
        <p>The <b>methods part</b> (documentation and final presentation) depicts your correct application of appropriate <strong>usability engineering methods</strong>. Do not only apply methods that have been presented or mentioned in class, rather read on and involve other methods you know or have read about. There are not “correct” or “incorrect” methods, so document the reasons for selecting or disregarding specific ones (both in your milestone and poster presentations). Document the results and insights they provided. The maximum credits can be reached based on the following expectations (in descending importance):</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Methodology</dt>
            <dd>The prototyping process is performed using a very structured approach. The choice of usability and user centered design methods are clearly motivated and correctly applied. More than the given methods were used. Iterations of the process phases are clearly visible.</dd>
            <dt>Results</dt>
            <dd>The selected evaluation outcomes are important and presented in a structured and clear way. The outcome of the evaluation is linked to concrete design improvements of the prototype. The results are discussed using the usability requirements as well as other appropriate criteria. Both evaluation outcomes as well as the implications for your prototype are critically discussed.</dd>
            <dt>Creativity</dt>
            <dd>The developed prototype is innovative and original.</dd>
            <dt>References</dt>
            <dd>The design and methodology choices are supported using literature (i.e. correct sources of the methods that have been applied), appropriate guidelines, design rules, or design patterns.</dd>
            <dt>Tools</dt>
            <dd>Various and multiple modeling/prototyping tools (paper, software) are used. The different provided tools are used appropriately.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The <b>prototyping part</b> (i.e. the code audit) of your grade will consist of the assessed <strong>functionality and interactive behavior of your prototype</strong>. The maximum credits can be reached based on the following expectations (in descending importance):</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Usability</dt>
            <dd>The prototype follows (not only the established) usability, readability and clarity rules (heuristics, patterns and guidelines). No usability bugs are present and found in the code audit.</dd>
            <dt>Techniques</dt>
            <dd>There is a very clean HTML structure. CSS is used accurately. The app stays on one page. The prototype relies heavily on JS and jQuery or other JS frameworks. Data is stored in objects. Interface components or APIs are used. Code is structured, reused and commented.</dd>
            <dt>Functionality</dt>
            <dd>Basic established use-cases (e.g., in case of a music app, playing any song in the library, or compiling arbitrary playlists) are functional.</dd>
            <dt>Level of Detail</dt>
            <dd>The created interaction allows a high (horizontal or vertical) capability. More than the tested experimental paths are implemented. "Experiencing" the app is possible in all program sections.</dd>

        </ol>

        <h4>GitHub benefits</h4>
        <p>GitHub is an online cloud service (online storage) which simplifies collaboration in IT projects. It is based on the software Git. The combination provides tools for solving conflicted versions of a file, merging different edits in the same document and backing up your project.</p>
        <p>The benefits of GitHub are threefold:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Version control</b> (all code revisions are stored, you can jump back)</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration</b> (your team can work together on the code)</li>
            <li><b>Cloud</b> (your app is stored in the internet and can be accessed via smartphones)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stages and commands of GitHub</h4>
        <p>Git is separated into four levels: <b>workspace/ working directory</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>local repository</b>, and <b>online repository</b>. The Git commands allow to organize these four levels to realize the high functionality of Git. A few important commands are explained in the following graphic.</p>
        <img src="images/github/git-stages.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="Git stages">
        <h4>Workspaces, branches, index, history, repository</h4>
        <p>The following list briefly explains the concepts. Items marked with <sup>*</sup> are the levels, we're going to work with during the course.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Workspace<sup>*</sup></dt>
            <dd>The workspace is the actual folder on your computer, within you make your modifications.</dd>
            <dt>History<sup>*</sup></dt>
            <dd>With the history function of Git and GitHub, it is possible to revert a single commit in the past or to roll back the whole project to a selected point. </dd>
            <dt>Local &amp; Online Repository<sup>*</sup></dt>
            <dd>These repositories are the “containers“, where your project is stored. After all synchronisation, both repositories, online and offline, are all the same.</dd>
            <dt>Branches</dt>
            <dd>Working with branches allows to test different versions of one commit. If you are not sure, which possibility might be the best one, you simply set up another branch und implement both versions at the same time. After you made your choice, you have the possibility to merge the commits from the two branches. In order to access your HTML/CSS/JS prototype directly as a www app (contrary to inspecting the code in the www), you need to use the branch <code>gh-pages</code>.</dd>
            <dt>Index</dt>
            <dd>As kind of a meta-level, the index isn‘t directly visible or editable. Before commiting your modifications, GitHub creates this index, which will be posted to your local repository.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Git commands</h4>
        <p>The following basic commands are necessary:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Commit</dt>
            <dd>Commit a file to bring it under versioning control (you can later revert to this revision or compare differences)</dd>
            <dt>Push</dt>
            <dd>Push a file to bring it online (available for other team members)</dd>
            <dt>Checkout</dt>
            <dd>Checkout of a file brings it back to your workspace in a certain version (available for inspection and modification)</dd>
            <dt>Pull</dt>
            <dd>Pull a file to bring it from the online repository to your local workspace.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Advanced GitHub commands</h4>
        <p>When using the GitHub GUI, you will find several buttons, which are not classic Git commands. These buttons often unite a few commands to one action that performs a special and necessary task. Again, items marked with <sup>*</sup> are the levels, we're most likely going to work with during the course.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sync<sup>*</sup></dt>
            <dd>The snyc action unites the commands add, commit, push, fetch and checkout. By syncing your local repository, you do load the latest version of the online repo while updating the online version with your commits. </dd>
            <dt>Revert<sup>*</sup></dt>
            <dd>The revert action creates a new commit that reverts all changes up to the selected commit (this means, the revert is also revertable).</dd>
            <dt>Roll-back</dt>
            <dd>The roll-back action reverts all changes that were committed after the selected commit. <span class="text-danger">This is not reversible!</span></dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>The GitHub client - a graphical user interface for Git</h4>
        <p>After installing and logging in to GitHub, you are ready to work with the Windows/Mac Client of GitHub. To advance the usability of working with Git as online cloud memory with several addons, you usually won’t need any commands in this GUI. Below you‘ll find some views of the GitHub GUI in different modes. Start by cloning (press the <img alt="github-plus" src="images/github/github-icon-plus.PNG"> icon) your group’s online repository and choose a folder, where you want your local workspace to be. </p>
        <p>You’ll now find your local repository overview in the left menu:</p>
        <img alt="local repository" class="img-responsive small" src="images/github/local-repo.png">
        <p>This shelters all the additional functionalities, which GitHub provides. For example, you can now start editing the files in your working directory. Therefore right-click the repository and select <kbd>Open in Explorer</kbd>. There you can add files or edit the existing ones.</p>
        <p>Whenever a file is modified, you can create a commit (“snapshot” of your current project state). The GitHub client recognizes and summarizes the changes in the area &quot;uncommitted changes&quot;, in the right area you will see all the changes in the files (and their differing content):</p>

        <img alt="committing changes" src="images/github/commiting-changes.png" class="img-responsive small">

        <p>You simply need to enter some text which describes your modifications (important for your teammates, e.g. “Functionality X improved” or “Bug Y fixed”) and press the commit button: <img src="images/github/github-icon-commit.png" alt="commit button"></p>
        <p>Before your edit appears online, you also need to push your changes from your local repository to the online repository. Instead of pushing/pulling, GitHub offers a synchronization of the online and local repositories. Simply press the corresponding button: <img src="images/github/github-icon-sync.png" alt="sync"></p>
        <p>You can explore the different revisions (or &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;) by clicking the different commits in your history. There you get a view of the differences (added/removed code for each file) and the possibility of reverting changes:</p>
        <p><img alt="reverting changes" src="images/github/revert.jpg" class="img-responsive small"></p>
        <p>Imagine you made a commit in the past and later on in your project you realize: this was not, what you wanted to do. Git simply gives you the possibility, to revert a single commit in the past: Select the commit, you want to revert (in the history). Press the <img src="images/github/github-icon-revert.png" alt="github revert icon"> button (this is only possible, if all pending changes where committed), you now have to commit/sync the revert. </p>
        <p>If two (or more) persons modified a file simultaneously, this will result in a conflict which you need to resolve by merging. Github will amend the conflicting file with conflict markers: The marker for a starting conflict is<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, while the end of the conflict is marked with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The two versions are separated by <code>=======</code>. Open the conflicting document with an editor of your choice (e.g. Brackets) and resolve the conflict by deleting the unwanted version and the markers. A file could look like this: </p>
        <pre>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Here is your change
=======
Here is another conflicting change
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; origin/gh-pages</pre>
        <p>Once you resolved the conflict, commit the merged file (don't forget to select it by clicking <img src="images/github/github-icon-select.png" alt="select in GitHub"> in the "Files to commit" area).</p>
        <h4>The branches</h4>
        <p>There is a concept called <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">&ldquo;branches&rdquo; in GitHub</a>, those are used for allowing a parallel workflow of multiple application versions in big software projects. Basically, one would create a copy of the existing application (create a branch), improve the functionality (without altering the main project branch, called the master branch), and once the functionality is there, discuss it and finally merge it to the master branch.</p>
        <p>For the interaction prototyping course, it&rsquo;s sufficient if you stay in the <code>master</code> branch (for private documents like tests, presentations, evaluation, …) or in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch (for the development of your application, which then will be publically available in the internet). Keep in mind: the latter branch is publically available in the internet. You need to select the appropriate branch in the top bar of your GitHub client: <img src="images/github/github-icon-branch.png" alt="github branch">.</p>
        <h4>Ready, steady, go!</h4>
        <p><strong>Find</strong> further information by reading the <a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub tutorials</a>. <strong>Create</strong> an arbitrary HTML document in your cloned repository. Provoke a <strong>conflict</strong>: multiple authors are editing this HTML document and synchronizing changes. Try to resolve the conflicts by merging the edits.

        <h3> Brainstorm ideas for an interactive mobile application</h3>
        <h4>Assignment</h4>
        <p> Make a <b> Mind Map</b> of ideas for an <b> interactive </b> mobile application. By interactive, stress is on the interaction between the application and the user, rather than on the application functionality. Think of new and innovative ways how a mobile application can be used, write these down and create a Mind Map. Either make a hand drawn (take a photo) or a software based (see below) Mind Map.</p>
        <p> The primary objective of this mind mapping process is to come up with a application prototype that has both features and functionality. More information regarding features and functionality can be found in <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/guerrilla-hci/"> Section 2.1 of Nielsen's Guerrilla HCI  </a>. As you will see, features are referred to as the horizontal component of prototyping and functionality is the vertical component. <b> The goal of  this course is for you to have a broad understanding of the horizontal features (viz. interaction) and to, by the end of the course, have implemented a limited set of the vertical functionality (also, interaction).</b> </p>
        <h4>Generate ideas and select the best ones</h4>
        <p>According to the <a href="http://www.jpb.com/creative/cps.php">creative problem solving</a> process (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming">general brainstorming rules</a>), strictly separate the two phases <em>convergent</em> (idea generation) and <em>divergent</em> (idea evaluation) thinking. Divergent thinking means a <a href="http://www.creaffective.de/en/publications/book-thinking-tools/">"broad search for many diverse and novel alternatives"</a>. Convergent thinking means a <a href="http://www.creaffective.de/en/publications/book-thinking-tools/">"focused and affirmative evaluation of alternatives"</a>. Separating those phases ensures, that you explore the topic broadly, consider all relevant factors, and find new alternatives. </p>
        <p>Basic rules for <strong>divergent thinking</strong> are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Defer judgement.</dt>
            <dd>Avoid any form (positive or negative), even thought, and defer to convergent phase.</dd>
            <dt>Strive for quantity.</dt>
            <dd>Generate many options to get the chance of finding good options. Whether an option is good or bad is judgment and therefore deferred. </dd>
            <dt>Seek wild ideas.</dt>
            <dd>“Wild and crazy” or “childish” ideas have great potential, even if it’s easier to develop than to implement!</dd>
            <dt>Make connections / build on other ideas.</dt>
            <dd> Combine and further develop existing elements, as thoughts are springboards for creating alternatives.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Basic rules for <b>convergent thinking</b> are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt></dt>
            <dd></dd>
            <dt>Apply affirmative judgment. </dt>
            <dd>Search for value instead of problems, this creates a positive attitude towards new (never perfect) ideas and their realization.</dd>
            <dt>Be deliberate.</dt>
            <dd> Dedicate time to judging option, consider options and check against criteria.</dd>
            <dt>Check your objectives.</dt>
            <dd>Options are answers to a question, always check the original question and whether or not an idea is on target.
            </dd>
            <dt>Keep novelty alive. </dt>
            <dd>New options are created also because existing solutions are not satisfactory, so always consider the novelty of an option.</dd>
            <dt>Improve ideas.</dt>
            <dd>An idea is a seed that needs time and care. Keep in mind to develop them further.

        <h4>Use cases (UML)</h4>
        <p>Specify your application <strong>functional requirements</strong> based on your personas and goals in a formal way. Use <a href="http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com/0596009828">UML Use Case Diagrams (see Chapter 2 Miles, 2006)</a> to describe the functional requirements of your application (e.g., buying, listening, rating, searching).</p>
        <p>Consider paths from starting the app until performing a certain action/goal (for example, in case of a music application, listening to a specific track). Consider deviations from that path (like, for a music application, &quot;music not found&quot;, &quot;music not offline available&quot;, or &quot;song preview&quot;).</p>
        <p>Ensure that the requirements match different application functionalities (e.g. media library, media store, playback functionalities). These are of course dependent on the original idea of the app.</p>
        <p>Use a graphic tools of your choice or an online tool like <a href="http://creately.com/diagram-type/use-case">Creately</a> (register for saving or take a screen shot)</p>

        <h4>Usability requirement and goals</h4>
        <p>Use your scenarios to create <strong>usability</strong> <strong>requirements and goals</strong>.The <em>functional</em> requirements you have already defined in the UML use cases. Check if these requirements are fullfilled with your current prototype. Feel free to adjust your requirements if needed. Note that, usability goals are user oriented and operationally defined (see Analysis lecture slides for more details; see <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalog/about-face-3-essentials-interaction-design/">Cooper (2007)</a>: <a href="http://proquest.tech.safaribooksonline.de/9780470084113"><em>About Face 3</em></a>).
            <h4>Principles</h4>

                <h3>Definition: Interaction and design framework</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking there are two ways for you to determine the design language/framework you can use in your app. You can <strong>use a predefined styleguide</strong> or you can <strong>define your own style</strong>. Where both approaches have advantages and disadvantages alike, it is your task to make an <strong>educated choice</strong> and <strong>document it properly</strong>. The choice of framework/design language strongly influences the interaction patterns your app is going to employ. Inform yourself on <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalog/about-face-3-essentials-interaction-design/">Cooper's (2007)</a> interaction framework (chapter 7) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.de/search?q=html+frameworks">design frameworks</a>.</p>
                <p>There are three best practices from which you may choose freely:</p>

Tips: don't be demotivated by the imperfection of your prototype, it is still a prototype at this freezing point. For all team members, please move on and be consentrated on the final evaluation.</p>

                    <h3>Evaluation: Data collection for the quantitative evaluation</h3>
                    <p>Collect data from 7 to 10 persons depicting your target group (relatives, friends, fellow students, etc.). Store the acquired data in a suitable manner.</p>
                    <p class="well well-sm"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i><b> Upload the data set </b>to a folder <code>iteration-4/data</code> in the GitHub <code>master</code> branch.</p>


                    <h3>Analysis: Statistical  analysis of the quantitative evaluation</h3>
                    <p>Please format your data for analysis in the statistical tool of your choice (Excel/SPSS/JMP/R). Perform a statistical analysis and reject or accept your hypothesis (a good overview on statistical analyses is given in <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/research/discovering-statistics-using-spss-34/">Field, 2009</a>). Make sure you check the assumptions of the tests before using them. Express the results in the best way for the audience of your final poster presentation (see below). Use <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalog/publication-manual-american-psychological-association-book/">APA6</a>-style diagrams (or tables) for this purpose and <strong>interpret</strong> your results with regards to your hypotheses and functional as well as usability requirements. </p>

                    <h3>Design: Design implications</h3>
                    <p>Use the results of the precendent final evaluation and design final (and detailed) interactions and usability improvements. </p>
                    <p class="well well-sm"><i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> <b>Create a report</b> (e.g. screenshots of design issues and paper-and-pencil solutions) of the design improvements in the folder <code>iteration-5/design</code> in the GitHub <code>master</code> branch. </p>


                    <h3>Final Poster Presentation</h3>
                    <p>Please prepare a poster (DIN A1) for the final presentation, which should include the <strong>whole methodological prototyping process </strong>that you used<strong>.</strong> Design the posters for<strong> new stakeholders </strong>(i.e. usability experts, evaluators, professors, ...) that do not know your methodological process yet. Focus on the <strong>iterative user centered design process</strong>. It is important to motivate the <em>evalation methods</em>, the<em> results</em>, as well as <em>design improvements</em>. Provide both an overview (all the methodological steps) and some highlights (details on chosen techniques/tools, important results, well-chosen design improvements). </p>
                    <p>Your poster should be self-explanatory and thus contain: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>motivations</strong> both for the application and the iterations (<em>users</em>, <em>goals</em>, <em>requirements</em>, ...)</li>
                        <li> an <strong>overview</strong> of your <strong>process</strong> <strong>iterations </strong>(used<em> methods</em>,<em> prototyping tools</em><strong>, </strong><em>evaluations, final application views</em>)</li>
                        <li>well chosen <strong>exemplary  details </strong>regarding <em>evaluation results</em> and<em> design  improvements</em></li>
                        <li><strong>discussions/conclusions</strong> of the <em>iterations</em></li>
                        <li>a <strong>hyperlink</strong> to the final web application (e.g. in form of a QR-code)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>During the poster <strong>presentation</strong> (exactly 15 minutes) you will give a short explanation of your overall work and <strong>demonstrate</strong> the mobile application. Ensure that each group member presents both methodological steps (poster) <strong>and</strong> prototype details (smartphone). Be prepared to answer additional <strong>questions</strong> afterwards (ca. 5 minutes). </p>
                    <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Important: </strong>Ensure that you address all the <strong>methodological</strong> <a href="#grading">grading critera described in the &quot;expectations, requirements and grading&quot; section above</a>.</p>
