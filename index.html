    INTRODUCTION
    -->
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is the practical team assignment for the course<strong> Interaction Prototyping</strong> (practical course taught at the Institute of Ergonomics, Technische Universität München) in the 
      <script>document.write(term);</script>
      . This document is optimized for being printed in Chrome.</p>
    <p>The team project aims to freely design and prototype an <b>interactive mobile application</b> in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Functionalities can freely and independently be designed by your team, depending on your creativity in brainstorming, the gathered user and usability requirements, as well as your use cases and scenarios. The user will be able to perform interactions, for example: buying, listing, viewing, informing, playing, searching.</p>
    <p><b>N.B.:</b> The course focuses on interaction <b>prototyping</b>. Even if your required/specified <em>feature</em> is not fully functional, you can simulate it and work on evaluating the corresponding <em>user interface.</em></p>
    <h4>General Information on the Practical Course:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>All the tasks during this project phase will be <b>group exercises</b> (groups of two to three persons). We recommend that every team member practices and contributes to the implementation part of the exercises. Establish interdisciplinary teams for working on your prototype. Find a name four your group.</li>
        <li><b>Document your implementational and methodological progress/process</b> throughout the whole project in a suitable manner (beginning at the first iteration) on GitHub. This will simplify the final project presentation. By using the history functionality of GitHub, you may return to earlier versions of your prototype.</li>
        <li>Each of the five iterations is planned for a <b>duration of two weeks.</b> Please ensure that you have pushed solutions for all exercises to GitHub at the end of the iteration. Your repository will be <a href="https://github.com/interactionprototyping">https://github.com/interactionprototyping/GROUP</a>, where GROUP is your group's chosen name. Set up a suitable file and folder structure; please indicate in the README.md, where your current version of your prototype can be found.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Expectations, Requirements, and Grading:</h4>
    <div class="well">Your final grade will consist of a <b>methodological  presentation (50%)</b> and an <b>audit of your prototype (50%)</b> </div>
    <p>The <b>methods part</b> (i.e. the presentation) depict your correct application of appropriate <strong>usability engineering methods</strong>. Do not only apply methods that have been presented or mentioned in class, rather read on and involve other methods you know or have read about. There are not “correct” or “incorrect” methods, so document the reasons for selecting or disregarding specific ones (both in your milestone and poster presentations). Document the results and insights they provided. The maximum credits can be reached based on the following expectations (in descending importance):</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Methodology</dt>
        <dd>The prototyping process is performed using a very structured approach. The choice of usability and user centered design methods are clearly motivated and correctly applied. More than the given methods were used. Iterations of the process phases are clearly visible.</dd>
        <dt>Results</dt>
        <dd>The selected evaluation outcomes are important and presented in a structured and clear way. The outcome of the evaluation is linked to concrete design improvements of the prototype. The prototypical results are discussed using the usability requirements that were created in the early stages of the process according to appropriate criteria. Both prototype results and evaluation outcomes are critically discussed.</dd>
        <dt>Creativity</dt>
        <dd>The developed prototype is intellectual independent, innovative and original.</dd>
        <dt>References</dt>
        <dd>The design and methodology choices are supported using literature (i.e. correct sources of the methods that have been applied), appropriate guidelines, design rules, or design patterns.</dd>
        <dt>Tools</dt>
        <dd>Various and multiple prototyping tools (paper, software) are used. The different provided tools are used appropriately.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The <b>prototyping part</b> (i.e. the code audit) of your grade will consist of the assessed <strong>functionality and interactive behavior of your prototype</strong>. The maximum credits can be reached based on the following expectations (in descending importance):</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Techniques</dt>
        <dd>There is a very clean HTML structure. CSS is used accurately. The app stays on one page. The prototype relies heavily on JS and jQuery or other JS frameworks. Data is stored in objects. Interface components or APIs are used. Code is structured, reused and commented.</dd>
        <dt>Usability</dt>
        <dd>The prototype follows (not only the established) usability, readability and clarity rules (heuristics, patterns and guidelines). No usability bugs are present and found in the code audit.</dd>
        <dt>Functionality</dt>
        <dd>Basic established use-cases (e.g., in case of a music app, playing any song in the library, or compiling arbitrary playlists), are functional.</dd>
        <dt>Level of Detail</dt>
        <dd>The created interaction allows a high (horizontal or vertical) prototypical capability. More than the tested experimental paths are implemented. "Experiencing" the app is possible in all program sections.</dd>
    </dl>

    </ol>
  
    <h4>GitHub Benefits</h4>
    <p>GitHub is an online cloud service (online storage) which simplifies collaboration in IT projects. It is based on the software Git. The combination provides tools for solving conflicted versions of a file, merging different edits in the same document and backing up your project.</p>
    <p>The benefits of GitHub are threefold:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Version control</b> (all code revisions are stored, you can jump back)</li>
        <li><b>Collaboration</b> (your team can work together on the code)</li>
        <li><b>Cloud</b> (your app is stored in the internet and can be accessed via smartphones)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Stages and commands of GitHub</h4>
    <p>Git is separated into four levels: <b>workspace/ working directory</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>local repository</b>, and <b>online repository</b>. The Git commands allow to organize these four levels to realize the high functionality of Git. A few important commands are explained in the following graphic.</p>
    <img src="images/github/git-stages.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="Git stages">
    <h4>Workspaces, Branches, Index, History, Repository</h4>
    <p>The following list briefly explains the concepts. Items marked with <sup>*</sup> are the levels, we're going to work with during the course.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Workspace<sup>*</sup></dt>
        <dd>The workspace is the actual folder on your computer, within you make your modifications.</dd>
        <dt>History<sup>*</sup></dt>
        <dd>With the history function of Git and GitHub, it is possible to revert a single commit in the past or to roll back the whole project to a selected point. </dd>
        <dt>Local &amp; Online Repository<sup>*</sup></dt>
        <dd>These repositories are the “containers“, where your  project is stored. After all synchronisation, both repositories, online and offline, are all the same.</dd>
        <dt>Branches</dt>
        <dd>Working with branches allows to test different versions of one commit. If you are not sure, which possibility might be the best one, you simply set up another branch und implement both versions at the same time. After you made your choice, you have the possibility to merge the commits from the two branches. In order to access your HTML/CSS/JS prototype directly as a www app (contrary to inspecting the code in the www), you need to use the branch <code>gh-pages</code>.</dd>
        <dt>Index</dt>
        <dd>As kind of a meta-level, the index isn‘t directly visible or editable. Before commiting your modifications, GitHub creates this index, which will be posted to your local repository.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>Git Commands</h4>
    <p>The following basic commands are necessary:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Commit</dt>
        <dd>Commit a file to bring it under versioning control (you can later revert to this revision or compare differences)</dd>
        <dt>Push</dt>
        <dd>Push a file to bring it online (available for other team members)</dd>
        <dt>Checkout</dt>
        <dd>Checkout of a file brings it back to your workspace in a certain version (available for inspection and modification)</dd>
        <dt>Pull</dt>
        <dd>Pull a file to bring it from the online repository to your local workspace.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>Advanced GitHub commands</h4>
    <p>When using the GitHub GUI, you will find several buttons, which  are not classic Git commands. These buttons often unite a few commands to one action that performs a special and necessary task. Again, items marked with <sup>*</sup> are the levels, we're most likely going to work with during the course.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Sync<sup>*</sup></dt>
        <dd>The snyc action unites the commands add, commit, push, fetch and checkout. By syncing your local repository, you do load the latest version of the online repo while updating the online version with your commits. </dd>
        <dt>Revert<sup>*</sup></dt>
        <dd>The revert action creates a new commit that reverts all changes up to the selected commit (this means, the revert is also revertable).</dd>
        <dt>Roll-back</dt>
        <dd>The roll-back action reverts all changes that were committed after the selected commit. <span class="text-danger">This is not reversible!</span></dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>The GitHub Client - A Graphical User Interface for Git</h4>
    <p>After installing and logging in to GitHub, you are ready to work with the Windows/Mac Client of GitHub. To advance the usability of working with Git as online cloud memory with several addons, you usually won’t need any commands in this GUI. Below you‘ll find some views of the GitHub GUI in different modes. Start by cloning (press the <img src="images/github/github-icon-plus.PNG"> icon) your group’s online repository and choose a folder, where you want your local workspace to be. </p>
    <p>You’ll now find your local repository overview in the left menu:</p>
    <img alt="local repository" class="img-responsive small" src="images/github/local-repo.png">
    <p>This shelters all the additional functionalities, which GitHub provides. For example, you can now start editing the files in your working directory. Therefore right-click the repository and select <kbd>Open in Explorer</kbd>. There you can add files or edit the existing ones.</p>
    <p>Whenever a file is modified, you can create a commit (“snapshot” of your current project state). The GitHub client recognizes and summarizes the changes in the area &quot;uncommitted changes&quot;, in the right area you will see all the changes in the files (and their differing content):</p>

    <img alt="committing changes" src="images/github/commiting-changes.png" class="img-responsive small">

    <p>You simply need to enter some text which describes your modifications (important for your teammates, e.g. “Functionality X improved” or “Bug Y fixed”) and press the commit button: <img src="images/github/github-icon-commit.png" alt="commit button"></p>
    <p>Before your edit appears online, you also need to push your changes from your local repository to the online repository. Instead of pushing/pulling, GitHub offers a synchronization of the online and local repositories. Simply press the corresponding button: <img src="images/github/github-icon-sync.png" alt="sync"></p>
    <p>You  can explore the different revisions (or &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;) by clicking the different  commits in your history. There you get a view of the differences (added/removed code for each file) and  the possibility of reverting changes:</p>
    <p><img alt="reverting changes" src="images/github/revert.jpg" class="img-responsive small"></p>
    <p>Imagine you made a commit in the past and later on in your project you realize: this was not, what you wanted to do. Git simply gives you the possibility, to revert a single commit in the past:
      Select the commit, you want to revert (in the history).
      Press the <img src="images/github/github-icon-revert.png" alt="github revert icon"> button (this is only possible, if all pending changes where committed), you  now have to commit/sync the revert. </p>
